## Synopsis

This program is designed to build and visualize a two-dimensional kd-tree for a set of points in the plane. This assignment consists of two parts: building the kd-tree and rendering/visualizing the kd-tree so that it looks like a Mondrian painting.

## Code
kd.cpp - computes the kdtree recursively
Makefile - makes and compiles the other files in the kdtree directory
kd.h - header file for kd.cpp
render.cpp - draws the kdtree

## Tests

Various tests were generated by students in the class and integrated into the code.
These test cases provide different sets of points to test the accuracy of the kdtree.


## Compile and Run
compile: run 'make' from the command line to compile

run: ./kdtree <number of points>

test: toggle between test cases by pressing letters on the keyboard. The following letters implement the following test cases: 
      ' ': random points
      'a': grid
      'b': diagonal line
      'c': circle
      ‘d’: spiral
